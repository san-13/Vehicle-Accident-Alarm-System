# Vehicle-Accident-Alarm-System

Real time gps location based alarming system tracking the road accident and providing medical assitance plus concern from near by police station.

## Overview
In case of a accident the device setup inside the car will be able to sense it and send a SOS signal via uploading the location of the accident to a cloud storage.
This cloud database will be continuously read by a client side application, which lists all the active SOS signals. When a nearby incident is found the concerned authorities that are monitoring the application can take action.
